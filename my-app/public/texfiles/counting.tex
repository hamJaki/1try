\section{The Basics of Counting}

Counting refers to determining the number of elements of a finite set. It forms the basis of combinatorics, the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration, combination, and permutation of sets.

\subsection{The Counting Principle}

If two events $A$ and $B$ are sequential, meaning event $B$ can only occur after event $A$, and if event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and event $B$ can occur in $n$ ways, then the total number of ways in which both $A$ and $B$ can occur is $m*n$.

\begin{equation}
\text{{total ways}} = m * n
\end{equation}

\subsection{Permutations}

Permutations refer to the arrangement of items in a specific order. The number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is:

\begin{equation}
^nP_r = n! / (n-r)!
\end{equation}

Where $n!$ stands for factorial and signifies the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

\subsection{Combinations}

Combinations refer to the selection of items where order does not matter. The number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is:

\begin{equation}
^nC_r = n! / [(n-r)!r!]
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}

Counting is fundamental to numerous areas of mathematics, including probability theory and algebra. Understanding these basic principles equips learners with the ability to tackle complex problems and mathematical proofs.

This is a very basic introduction. Each topic, especially permutations and combinations, can be expanded with more complex ideas and formulas. Also, don't forget to import the `amsmath` package at the beginning of your LaTeX document.

\subsection{The Pigeonhole Principle}
Sure, the Pigeonhole Principle is a fairly simple but incredibly useful theory in mathematics, particularly in the field of combinatorics. Essentially, the Pigeonhole Principle states if we distribute n items into m containers and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. Here's how this information might be written in LaTeX:

```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\title{The Pigeonhole Principle}
\maketitle

The Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental theorem used in the field of combinatorics. It is a simple yet powerful tool that allows us to determine the minimum number of outcomes in certain types of problems.

\section*{Description}

Suppose that you have $n$ items which you want to distribute into $m$ containers. The Pigeonhole Principle states that, if $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In other words, if there are more items than containers, then at least one container must hold at least two items.

\section*{Mathematical Expression}

The original form of the Pigeonhole Principle can be formally stated as follows:

\[
\text{If } n \text{ items are distributed into } m \text{ containers and } n > m \text{, then at least one container contains more than one item.}
\]

In more general terms, if $n$ items are to be distributed in $m$ containers, then at least one container should have the ceiling of $n/m$ items.
\[
\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil \text{ items per container}.
\]

\section*{Examples}

\subsection*{(1) Simple application}

If 3 socks are selected from a drawer containing just 2 different colors, then we will have at least two socks of the same color. This is because if we distribute 3 items (socks) into 2 containers (color groups), $n > m$ implies we have at least one container with more than one item.

\subsection*{(2) Generalized application}

Suppose in a city of 1,000,000 people, at least two people have the same number of hairs on their heads. This claim is a direct application of the Pigeonhole Principle. The number of hairs on a human's head can vary, but it roughly ranges from 0 (bald) to approximately 150,000. As per the principle, there are more people (1,000,000) than possible amounts of hair (150,000). Thus, at least two people in the city share the same number of hairs.

Please note that you need LaTeX software to run the above Latex code and it will give you detailed document with all mathematical expressions. This is just a simple explanation of Pigeonhole Principle, depending on the complexity of the concept one wants to discuss, this can go deeper and more complex.

\subsection{Permutations and Combinations}
Permutations and combinations are a part of combinatorial mathematics which deals with counting, arrangement, and listing of objects following some particular rules. They are essential in probability theory.

A permutation is the arrangement of objects, without repetition, where the order is important. For $n$ distinct items, there are $n$ ways to choose the first, $n-1$ ways to choose the second, ..., and 1 way to choose the last. This is expressed as $n$ factorial, denoted as $n!$, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. 

In LaTeX, $n!$ is written as `n!` .

The number of permutations of $n$ distinct items taken $r$ at a time, denoted as $_nP_r$, expressed in LaTeX as `nPr`, can be calculated as:

\[
_nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\]

Expressed in LaTeX as:

```
\_nP\_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
```

A combination, on the other hand, is the selection of items where order does not matter. The number of combinations of $n$ distinct items taken $r$ at a time, denoted as $_nC_r$, expressed in LaTeX as `nCr`, can be calculated as:

\[
_nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

Expressed in LaTeX as:

```
\_nC\_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
```

This formula demonstrates that when choosing r elements, the order of selection does not matter. So for combinations, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of ways to arrange the $r$ items among themselves, which is $r!$.

\subsection{Binomial Coefficients and Identities}
Sure, here are some detailed information on "Binomial Coefficients and Identities" in LaTeX format. 

The combination of selecting r items from a set of n items is often denoted by:

\[
{n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

where n! refers to the factorial of n and is the product of all positive integers up to n, and $n \choose r$ is read as "n choose r". This is also known as a binomial coefficient.

The binomial theorem describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial. The theorem is often quote as follows:

\[
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} x^{n-k} y^k
\]

In the above expression, ${n \choose k}$ are the binomial coefficients.

There are several well-known identities involving binomial coefficients. Here are a few of them:

1. Symmetry Identity: If 0 <= r <= n then

\[
{n \choose r} = {n \choose n-r}
\]

2. Pascal's Identity: If 1 <= r <= n then

\[
{n \choose r} = {(n-1) \choose (r-1)} + {(n-1) \choose r}
\]

3. Binomial Coefficients in Terms of Factorials:

\[
{n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

4. Expansion of a binomial raised to a power n:

\[
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} x^k y^{n-k}
\]

All these identities have important applications and aid in both algebraic computations and combinatorial arguments.

\subsection{Generalized Permutations and Combinations}
Sure, here is an explanation about "Generalized Permutations and Combinations" in LaTeX format:

The topic of generalized permutations and combinations delves into advanced counting strategies which enable us to handle more complex arrangements and selections, often involving repetition.

### Permutations

A permutation refers to an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of a set of `n` distinct items is given by `n!` (n factorial), defined as: 
  
  ```latex
  n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
  ```
  
But in many cases, we don't want to arrange all the items, but rather a subset of them, say `r` items. In such cases, we use a reduced form of the factorial which only counts the first `r` terms. This reduced factorial is often denoted `nPr` or `P(n, r)` and is calculated as:
  
  ```latex
  P(n, r) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
  ```
  
### Combinations

Combinations are similar to permutations, but in this case the order of the items doesn't matter. The number of combinations of `r` items that can be selected from a set of `n` items (denoted `nCr` or `C(n, r)`) can be calculated by modifying the permutation formula to "remove" the `r!` different ways the same selection can be arranged:

 ```latex
 C(n, r) = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
 ```
 
### Permutations and Combinations with Repetition

In permutations and combinations with repetition, each item can be selected more than once. 

The formula for permutations with repetition for `n` items taken `r` at a time is: 
```latex
n^r
```
For combinations with repetition (also known as multiset combinations or combinations with replacement), the formula becomes more complex:

```latex
C(n+r-1, r) = \frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}
```

These formulas offer us an advanced method to count and solve problems involving ordering or selection, even when items can be repeated. Examples of their application range from password formation scenarios to determining the number of potential lineups in sports games. 

Understanding the concept of generalized permutations and combinations adds a strong tool to your mathematical tool kit, especially in realms of probability and statistics.

\subsection{Generating Permutations and Combinations}
Sure, here it is:

Permutations and combinations are fundamental concepts in mathematics, especially in statistics and probability theory. Permutations are concerned with the arrangement of objects, where the order is important, whereas combinations are concerned with the selection of objects, where the order is not important.

\section{Permutations}

In the study of permutations, order matters. For example, consider the objects `A`, `B`, and `C`. The permutations of these objects are `ABC`, `ACB`, `BAC`, `BCA`, `CAB`, and `CBA`, resulting in a total of 6 permutations.

Mathematically, you can find the number of permutations using the factorial function. 

The number of permutations of a set of `n` distinct objects is given by `n!` (n factorial), which is defined as:

\[ n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \]

\section{Combinations}

Combinations are about selecting items where the order does not matter. For example, consider selecting 2 letters from `A`, `B`, `C`. We can select `AB`, `AC`, `BC`. These are Combinations.

The number of combinations of `n` objects taken `k` at a time is given by:

\[ C(n, k) = \frac{{n!}}{{k!(n - k)!}} \]

where `n!` is as defined above, and `k!` is the number of ways to arrange `k` items, and `(n - k)!` is the number of ways to arrange the differences.

This is more popularly known as the binomial coefficient and is used extensively in binomial expansions and studying various properties in statistics such as in the bell curve in the normal distribution. 

These concepts of permutations and combinations lay the foundation to the principals of counting rules which are widely used in probability theory, finite mathematics and in computer science for designing algorithms.
