\title{Sets}
\maketitle

In mathematics, a \textbf{set} is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. We usually represent sets by a series of numbers or elements enclosed within curly braces \(\{\}\).

\section*{Notations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Set membership:} If an element \(a\) belongs to a set \(A\), this is denoted as \(a \in A\). If \(a\) does not belong to \(A\), this is denoted as \(a \notin A\).

  \item \textbf{Subsets:} A set \(A\) is said to be a subset of a set \(B\) if every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\), written as \(A \subseteq B\). All sets are subsets of themselves, and the empty set \(\emptyset\) is a subset of any set.

  \item \textbf{Intervals:} For real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), with \(a < b\), the open interval \((a, b)\) is the set of all numbers between \(a\) and \(b\), not including \(a\) and \(b\) themselves. The closed interval \([a, b]\) is the same set, but including \(a\) and \(b\).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Operations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Union:} The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the collection of points which are in \(A\), in \(B\), or in both. It is denoted as \(A \cup B\).

  \item \textbf{Intersection:} The intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements which are in both \(A\) and \(B\). It is denoted as \(A \cap B\). If the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\) contains no elements, \(A\) and \(B\) are said to be disjoint or mutually exclusive.

  \item \textbf{Difference:} The difference of the set \(B\) from the set \(A\) is the set of all elements that are in \(A\) but not in \(B\). It is denoted as \(A \setminus B\).
  
  \item \textbf{Complement:} The complement of the set \(A\) with respect to a set \(B\) is the set of all elements in \(B\) but not in \(A\). It is often denoted as \(A'\) or \(A^c\).
\end{itemize}

Please note, these definitions are a fundamental basis of set theory and a building block of the foundational systems of mathematics.

This LaTeX script provides a basic introduction to sets, including explanations of set notation, subset notation, intervals, and standard operations such as union, intersection, difference, and complement.

\subsection{Set Operations}
In LaTeX format, the topic of "Set Operations" involves introducing the key types of operations performed on sets such as Union, Intersection, Difference, and Complement. It involves discussion on how these operations impact sets and their elements. Here, I provide a brief LaTeX-ed explanation of each:

A "set" is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are represented by uppercase letters.

Set A: $A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$
Set B: $B = \{d, e, f, g, h\}$

1. **Union of Two Sets**

The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements in A, or B, or both. The symbol $\cup$ is used to represent union.

$A \cup B = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\}$

2. **Intersection of Two Sets**

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of elements that are common to both sets. The symbol $\cap$ represents the intersection.

$A \cap B = \{d, e\}$

3. **Difference of Two Sets**

The difference of the set A and set B is a set that consists of elements that belong to A and not to B. The symbol $\setminus$ represents the difference.

$A \setminus B = \{a, b, c\}$
$B \setminus A = \{f, g, h\}$

4. **Complement of a Set**

The complement of a set A refers to the elements not in set A. Complement of A with respect to Universal set U is denoted by $A^c$ or $\overline{A}$.

If $U = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j\}$ then  
$\overline{A} = U \setminus A = \{f, g, h, i, j\}$
$\overline{B} = U \setminus B = \{a, b, c, i, j\}$

The above is only a subset of all possible set operations, and more complex operations can be built out of these fundamental ones.

\subsection{Functions}
Sure, here is a brief explanation:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output.

This concept can be represented in Mathematical terms with the following notation:

\begin{verbatim}
f : X -> Y
\end{verbatim}

where "X" is the set of inputs and "Y" is the set of outputs.

In other words, for every element "x" in set "X", there exists exactly one element "y" in set "Y", such that the ordered pair (x, y) belongs to the function "f".

This is written mathematically as:

\begin{verbatim}
\forall x \in X, \exists ! y \in Y, (x,y) \in f.
\end{verbatim}

Another common way to represent a function is:

\begin{verbatim}
y = f(x)
\end{verbatim}

The variable "y" depends on the chosen input "x" and is determined by the rule established by "f".

A more concrete example of a function is:

\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = 2x + 5
\end{verbatim}

In this example function, for every input "x", the output is "2x + 5".

Whether dealing with simple linear functions like the one above, or more complex functions, the defining characteristic that sets functions apart is that each input has exactly one corresponding output.

In order to properly represent mathematical expressions in a format such as LaTeX, please note that you should surround the expressions with the dollar sign "$" symbol to prompt LaTeX to interpret the enclosed text as a mathematical expression. 

Hereâ€™s an example:

\begin{verbatim}
$f : X \rightarrow Y$
\end{verbatim}

Moreover, LaTeX also supports equation environments for more complex mathematical structures as shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
f(x) = 2x + 3
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim} 

The use of \begin and \end specifies the beginning and the end of the relevant environment. The "equation" mode inside them tells LaTeX to interpret the contained text as an equation. 

Another example using LaTeX symbols:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in X, \exists ! y \in Y, (x,y) \in f.
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Sequences and Summations}
Certainly. 

To type mathematical expressions in LaTeX, you enclose everything within dollar signs (\$...\$). I'll provide a brief introduction to sequences, sum of sequences (series), infinite series and basic notation.

1. **Sequences**

A sequence is a succession of numbers, each of which is called a term. In a sequence \{a_n\}, the term \$a_n\$ depends on \$n\$, which is a positive integer. A sequence is defined as: 

```latex
\$a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\$
```

Here, \$a\$ is a function of \$n\$ that maps every positive integer to a real number.

2. **Summations**

The summation of terms in a sequence is represented using the Greek capital letter Sigma (\$\Sigma\$). If we have a sequence from \$a_1\$ to \$a_n\$ and want to calculate the sum, it is represented as: 

```latex
\$\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\$
```

This means we sum all terms \$a_i\$ from \$i=1\$ to \$i=n\$.

3. **Infinite Series**

If we extend the sum of a sequence to infinity, we get an infinite series. An infinite series is represented as:

```latex
\$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i\$
```

This means we sum all terms \$a_i\$ from \$i=1\$ to \$i=\infty\$ (infinity).

4. **Summation Notation**

Often, it is necessary to express the fact that the terms of a sequence are related in a mathematical formula. This can be done using summation notation. For example, consider a sequence where each term is the square of its order number, i.e., \$a_i = i^2\$. The sum of the first \$n\$ terms of this sequence is then:

```latex
\$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2\$
```

In the context of calculus, sequences and summations form the basis for defining limits, derivatives, and integrals. In particular, the study of infinite series is a major part of calculus and analysis.

\subsection{Cardinality of Sets}
The cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements in the set". It is a foundational topic in set theory and plays a crucial role in various areas of mathematics. Here's a detailed explanation in LaTeX:

\begin{document}

\section*{Definition of Cardinality}
The cardinality of a set $A$ is the number of elements in the set and is denoted by $|A|$. For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ then $|A| = 4$. 

\section*{Finite and Infinite Sets}
A set is said to be finite if its cardinality is a natural number, i.e., $|A|=n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Otherwise, the set is infinite.  For instance, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is infinite as it has infinitely many elements.

\section*{Cardinality of Infinite Sets}
Not all infinite sets have the same size or cardinality. For instance, $\mathbb{N}$ (set of all natural numbers), $\mathbb{Z}$ (set of all integers), and $\mathbb{Q}$ (set of all rational numbers) have the same cardinality, represented by the Hebrew letter $\aleph_0$ (aleph-null or countable infinity). 

On the other hand, the set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ has a larger cardinality, denoted by $2^{\aleph_0}$ or $\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).

These cardinalities are compared using one-to-one correspondences or bijections. Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality if there is a bijection $f: A\to B$.

\section*{Cardinal Arithmetic}
The operations on cardinals such as sum, product, and exponentiation are also defined. Here, we describe the sum of two cardinals. If $A$ and $B$ are two disjoint sets, then
$$|A\cup B| = |A|+|B|$$
provided at least one of $|A|$ or $|B|$ is a finite cardinal.

\end{document}

This provides a crucial premise for understanding more advanced topics in set theory like Russell's paradox, the axiom of choice etc.

\subsection{Matrices}
Sure, here is a general explanation of the topic "Matrices" in LaTeX format.

We can begin with the definition of a matrix:

\begin{verbatim}
In linear algebra, a Matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The numbers in the matrix are called it's elements or entries. An $m \times n$ matrix, has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. An $m \times n$ matrix is given by

 \[A =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
  \end{bmatrix}\]
\end{verbatim}

Moving on to matrix operations, let's consider addition:

\begin{verbatim}
Matrix addition is performed element by element. If A and B are the same size, their sum C = A + B is a matrix the same size as A and B, and its elements are the sums of the corresponding elements in A and B.

 \[\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}+b_{11} & a_{12}+b_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}+b_{1n} \\
    a_{21}+b_{21} & a_{22}+b_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n}+b_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1}+b_{m1} & a_{m2}+b_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}+b_{mn}
  \end{bmatrix}\]
\end{verbatim}

In matrix multiplication:

\begin{verbatim}
Assuming A is an n Ã— m matrix and B is an m Ã— p matrix, their product AB is an n Ã— p matrix, where the elements are given by dot products of the corresponding row of A and the corresponding column of B. 

The (i, j)-th entry of the product is obtained by multiplying each entry of the i-th row of A by its corresponding entry in the j-th column of B, and then summing up all these products.

  \[(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^m a_{ik}b_{kj}\]
\end{verbatim} 

We could also discuss special types of matrices, such as the identity matrix and the inverse matrix. But that would build upon the foundational understanding of matrices discussed earlier.
